"<p>Our ideal is a world where all people enjoy close relationships like "
"members of one family. Unfortunately, today, there are many married people "
"who not necessarily can honestly enjoy sufficiently close relationships with "
"people outside of their family, especially with people of opposite gender, "
"as those relationships are often misunderstood and mistreated by others. "
"People often resort to divorces because of that. We think that in many cases "
"divorces are not necessary, and married couples tend to understand that, "
"beginning to be more like brothers and sisters, and giving each others the "
"freedom to make close friends in our lives. However, unlike our spouses, the "
"society is not as tolerant, and is quick to misconstrue close friendships as "
"infidelity to one's spouse. In modern society, thus, simply having close "
"friends becomes risky. To reduce the risk, we need more understanding, not "
"just from our lovers, but from the society at large. Therefore, we created "
"this site to enable people to clearly specify and share the expectations of "
"their spouses to their friends whom they want to have closer relationships "
"with. We think the more we have close and intimate relationships in the "
"soiety, and excite each others' minds, the more people will share resources "
"and help, and the more projects we will realize, cures for diseases found, "
"etc., which is a win for everyone.</p>\n"
