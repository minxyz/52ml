"<p>Our ideal is a world where all people enjoy close relationships like "
"members of one family. Unfortunately, today, there are many married people "
"who not necessarily can honestly enjoy sufficiently close relationships with "
"people outside of their family, especially with people of opposite gender, "
"as those relationships are often misunderstood and mistreated by others. "
"People often resort to divorces because of that. We think that in many cases "
"divorces are not necessary, and married couples tend to understand that, "
"beginning to be more like brothers and sisters, and giving each others the "
"freedom to make close friends in our lives. However, unlike our spouses, the "
"society is not as tolerant, and is quick to misconstrue close friendships as "
"infidelity to one's spouse. In modern society, thus, simply having close "
"friends becomes risky. To reduce the risk, we need more understanding, not "
"just from our lovers, but from the society at large. Therefore, we created "
"this site to enable people to clearly specify and share the expectations of "
"their spouses to their friends whom they want to have closer relationships "
"with. We think the more we have close and intimate relationships in the "
"soiety, and excite each others' minds, the more people will share resources "
"and help, and the more projects we will realize, cures for diseases found, "
"etc., which is a win for everyone.</p>\n"

"<p>我们的理想是把全世界做一个家庭一样好关系的。我们认识到着世界上的很多结婚夫"
"妇不一定能满足互相的所有的需求。可是，我们觉得很多情况下不一定要离婚（『没离"

"中，社会不一定理解这样的行为。有时候，社会很快曲解关系，很快以为有亲密好友意"
"味着对丈夫还是妻子不忠。不忠不等于亲密朋友。我们创造了这个网站为了大家都可以"
"明确地分享关于自己的妻子或丈夫的期望值对对方的亲密好友的关系，创造个对做亲密"
