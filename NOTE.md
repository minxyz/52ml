=========================

《It is easy to break family, it's hard to make the world into one family. But we choose to fly to the Moon and do other great things, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.》

我们的理想是把全世界做一个家庭一样好关系的。认识到着世界上的很多结婚夫妇不一定能满足互相的所有的需求。可是，我们觉得很多情况下不一定要离婚（没离就魅力）。可是，虽然夫妇互相理解，而且互相给许可找亲密的朋友们，社会不一定理解这样的行为。有时候，社会很快曲解《好友关系》和《不忠》。我们创造了这个网站为了大家都可以明确地分享关于自己的丈夫或者妻子的期望值对对方的好友。

爱魅力介绍一种 Geek Code ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geek_Code )，为了可以清楚地描写而且跟好友更明确地分享关于自己的配偶关系。
